Operation Systems final project

The Operating System course final project focused on implementing a basic threading mechanism in the xv6 operating system. The project aimed to create kernel-level threads through system calls, including 'clone' for thread creation, 'join' for synchronization, and 'thread_create' as a higher-level abstraction. The main objectives were to design a new system call 'thread_create' to simplify the thread creation process, enable thread synchronization through locking and unlocking, and demonstrate the functionality of the implemented threading mechanism by executing a simple 'hello world' program across multiple threads. The project also involved understanding the page directory layout and stack allocation to ensure proper thread execution and efficient resource management. Overall, the project showcased the ability to enhance the operating system's capabilities by implementing a user-level thread library on top of the xv6 kernel.
